  $$<p>The primary investigation for suspected acoustic neuroma is imaging of the brain, specifically targeting the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal.</p><p><strong>NICE Recommendations and General Approach:</strong></p><p>While NICE does not have a specific guideline for "Acoustic Neuroma" per se, guidance on hearing loss and neurological symptoms indirectly supports the diagnostic pathway. Referral pathways for hearing loss and neurological symptoms are crucial.</p><p><strong>Initial Assessment:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Full Otological and Neurological Examination:</strong> Assess cranial nerve function (especially CN V, VII, VIII), cerebellar signs, and gait.</li><li><strong>Audiometry:</strong> Essential for any patient with unilateral hearing symptoms. A pure tone audiogram will typically show an asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, often more pronounced at higher frequencies. Speech discrimination scores may be disproportionately poor compared to pure tone thresholds (rollover phenomenon), although this is not pathognomonic.</li><li><strong>Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Audiometry:</strong> Can be used as a screening tool, especially if MRI is contraindicated or not readily available. A prolonged interaural latency difference (I-V interval) or absent waves indicate retrocochlear pathology. However, MRI is more sensitive and specific.</li></ul><p><strong>Definitive Imaging:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Gadolinium Contrast:</strong> This is the gold standard investigation.<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides high-resolution imaging of the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle.</li><li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Acoustic neuromas typically appear as well-circumscribed, intensely enhancing lesions arising from the vestibulocochlear nerve, extending from the internal auditory canal into the cerebellopontine angle. Small intracanalicular tumours can be identified.</li><li><strong>NICE implications:</strong> While not explicitly stating "MRI for suspected AN," NICE guidance on unilateral sensorineural hearing loss or unexplained neurological symptoms would lead to MRI of the brain. For example, the NICE guideline for Suspected neurological conditions: recognition and referral (NG12, last updated 2023) recommends considering urgent referral for neuroimaging for patients with new onset focal neurological deficit.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Contrast CT Scan:</strong> Not the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing acoustic neuromas as it has poor soft tissue resolution compared to MRI. However, it may be used in emergencies (e.g., acute hydrocephalus) or if MRI is contraindicated. It can show bony erosion of the internal auditory canal or signs of hydrocephalus.</li></ul><p>Note: Initial assessments are completed by the GP. Acoustic neuromas are <strong>benign tumors</strong>, so they <strong>do not automatically qualify for a 2-week cancer referral</strong>. However, should the GP suspect Acoustic Neuroma, the patient is referred to ENT or neuro-otology clinic, at which point further investigations are carried out.</p><p><strong>Genetic Testing:</strong></p><ul><li>Consider genetic testing for <em>NF2</em> gene mutation in patients with suspected or confirmed bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or if there is a strong family history of NF2.</li></ul>$$,
